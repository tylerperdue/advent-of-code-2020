## Day 2

### Part 1

Find all valid passwords in `src/passwords.txt` and return the count.

Definition of valid password: character occurs between min and max. 

For example: 

* 8-9 n: nnnnnnnnn => valid; 9 n's
* 14-15 d: dzjgbdwdkdhdddh => invalid; 7 d's

### Part 2

Find all valid passwords in `src/passwords.txt` and return the count.

Definition of valid password: character found at position only once.

For example: 

* 8-9 n: nnnnnnnnn => invalid; both 8 and 9 are n
* 14-15 d: dzjgbdwdkdhdddh => valid; 14 is d, 15 is h

### Reflection

Still struggling. But getting more comfortable with the syntax.

String parsing was not fun... hopefully future problems are a little less heavy.

Struct static methods are helpful but I could see it going full OOP too quickly. 

Not super happy with my implementation but I was crunched for time today. 

Hoping to dive a little deeper into other features of the language the next few days.
