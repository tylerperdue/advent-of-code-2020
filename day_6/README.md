## Day 6

### Part 1

Simulated customs questions after exiting a plane. Given a list of answers to questions (a-z).

Count the number of unique questions per group in `src/answers` and return the sum.

### Part 2

Count the number of questions which everyone in a group responded with 'yes'.

### Reflection

Easy (with a hash map).

Rust is eating these larger puzzle inputs for breakfast. Super performant.

I'm still not seeing much of a use case for Rust outside of high performance/systems programming. 

For a reg service, I think Go's simplicity wins. Easier to write and read.

I'm still only at the surface. I think it would take weeks (months?) to really be productive in this language. 

Wanna checkout concurrency next...
