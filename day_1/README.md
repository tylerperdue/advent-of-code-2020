### Reflection

Rust is hard. The compiler is so complex. Sometimes helpful, offering suggestions. Somethings speaking an entirely different language. 

Struggled with the differences between `String`, `&String`, and `&str`. 

Error handling is more verbose than Golang. At least so far...

Love the `Option` and `Result` flow but wish there was a better way to bind and pipeline. 

Once it's compiled, this stuff works. And it's fast.
