## Day 3

### Part 1

Count the number of trees (#) encountered when progressing through `src/slopes.txt` at a right 3, down 1 (3, 1) rate.

### Part 2

Count the number of trees (#) encountered when progressing through `src/slopes.txt` at a [(1, 1), (3, 1), (5, 1), (7, 1), (1, 2)] rate and return the product.

### Reflection

Starting to understand the basic types, function flow with Results/Options. 

Not really getting a good grasp on the memory and lifetime stuff. Ex: borrowing vs. copying, etc.

The compiler continues to impress me. This code is very safe but I see some gaps. 

Those gaps make me think I'm missing something... maybe we'll find it in day 4. 

Used a map and fold to bind a few things together! I really like line 47.
