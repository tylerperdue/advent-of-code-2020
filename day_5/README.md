## Day 5

### Part 1

Find the highest seat id given a list of binary space paritions. Where a seat id is equal to row * 8 + column.

A boarding pass has a standard format: FBFBFBFLLR. 

Where: 
- The first 7 characters indicate the row
- The last 3 characters indicate the column

### Part 2

You lost your boarding pass. Find the missing seat amongst the seat id's calculated above.

### Reflection

Great use of closures. 

Only 1 method that I'm not happy with and that's mostly bc I got lazy.

Iterators are super powerful. Kinda reminds me of python but with stronger types and speed.

Getting more comfortable with the syntax now but hoping the next few challenges force me to explore other parts of the language.
